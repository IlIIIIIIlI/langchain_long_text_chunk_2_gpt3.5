currently text-davinci-3 only accepts 4096 tokens for each prompt. but this script can allows it accepts more, more, more than 4096 tokens.
Try this script to QA shakespeare's book.
This is a super easy script to achieving when you needs to search big text-based data. By using langchain you can easily achieve it!

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- add your own openai key, and remember change the question to what you wanna ask the documents.
- python main.py

Enjoy~
